<!--
  The ONE hand-edited status block.  tools/gen_port_ledger.py injects everything
  below the marker line verbatim into docs/STATUS.md's "Current front" section, so
  STATUS can never drift from reality.  Update THIS when the active front moves;
  keep it short (a 60-second read).  Everything else in STATUS is derived from code.

  RULES (the 2026-06-09 cleanup): keep ONLY open/forward-looking items here. When
  an item RESOLVES, move its story to PROGRESS.md / the findings doc in the same
  edit — do not let resolved arcs accumulate.  Full pre-cleanup snapshots:
  archive/FRONT-2026-06-09-full.md (world-map backlog, dialogue fixes, load-arc,
  shop-display chips) and archive/FRONT-2026-07-01-full.md (the whole
  customer-service/haggle + §21 determinism arc, title/pause/guild/prologue arcs,
  trace-studio-v3 build-out).  Code-tagged PORT-DEBT lives in docs/port-debt.md
  (derived) — FRONT only carries debts NOT yet tagged in src/.

<!-- FRONT:BEGIN -->
- **★★★ ACTIVE — first-customer trace (`house-firstcust-arrprobe`, win-0-1500): the ANIM SEED-ORIGIN PHASE class.**
  Baseline: the rng-value stream, NPC positions, db054, and every anchor are 1:1 — **USER-CONFIRMED 2026-07-01**
  ("npcs aligned, customer aligned"; `findings/confirmed-parity-ledger.md`, RE §21.10–§21.25 in
  `findings/customer-service-haggle-RE.md`).  **REMAINING (a SEPARATE root, NOT the rng stream):** #21 tear
  wing-flap cframe phase + the browsing-customer walk-CYCLE phase (body-pose slip where facing+path already
  match; viewer notes #20/#21/#22 open).  Diagnosis so far (old notes #10/#18): cframe runs 1f-ahead during
  load, 1f-behind free-roam ⇒ inconsistent direction = the chr_anim seed ORIGIN (seed timing, not rate),
  entangled with the load/arrival anim-seed timing.  The companion's transition-frame chr_anim_tick skip is
  CORRECT (player skips identically, scene1_player_ctrl.c:1705, 1:1) — don't re-suspect it.
- **★ IN FLIGHT 2026-07-01 — `{bgnpcseed}` applied to `house-firstcust-cutscene-day2`** (same savefile ⇒ same
  naturals; via the §21.25 fix both sides auto-skip its own `{bgnpcpin}` SoA inject).  Verify drive
  (`scenario-test --target both --call-trace` → `flow_diff --field-timeline` bgx0..5 + raw rng) pending.
- **★ OPEN GAPS queued on this trace (user-flagged):**
  - **(ii) dialogue-under-ESC-modal:** retail shows NO dialogue behind the ESC-skip while the port is
    mid-reveal of a line — should the port hide/clear the underlying dialogue when the ESC choice box is up?
    (The autonomous-able next gap.)
  - **#7/#19 modal double-render = the cutscene FOCUS/BLUR RT effect.**  Retail renders the WHOLE in-game
    frame (scene+UI) an extra time via the capture-RT composite (the manga-lines 集中線 machinery; the
    retail-only b494 draw) ⇒ the choice box's two faint passes compound under alpha ("stronger edges" #7,
    "weird blending" #19).  The box draw itself is bit-identical; the port has the RT infra (screen_rt.c,
    FUN_0047ae65) but doesn't run the effect here.  **FIX = port the double-render + RT composite — BLOCKED
    on a v3 RT-capture extension** (SetRenderTarget/CopyRects replay empty today).  NB the manga-lines effect
    for the cc08==4 scene itself is ALREADY PORTED + user-confirmed (2026-06-20) — this is the ESC-modal
    instance only.
  - Pending explicit user re-confirm (minor): the note-#1 sell-counter "!" emote fix (2026-06-20,
    `house-customer-walk-probe`) was never separately re-confirmed.
- **★★ QUEUED ARC — CUSTOMER INTERACTIONS deep-dive (user directive 2026-06-22).**  Mechanics the user named
  (verify in code, don't trust the wiki): (1) CLOSENESS/affinity per customer; (2) ATMOSPHERE score from shop
  DECORATION.  Includes: **L1b** real accept side-effects (cs-live-sale-fx: gold += ask, stock decrement,
  catalog/inventory/payout FUN_00460d52/b3a/606fc/00083/0002a/00b93, all f404==0); the roster scan
  (cs-roster-scan); live-haggle render fidelity (customer art/dialogue); **the iv1_8 chain** (f406→f402
  post-first-customer EXTRA_SPRITE cutscene) → the cutscene series → day-2 brooming.  Separate follow-up:
  the DAY-2 cutscene blink-stall (~frame 21259+, does not affect the cc08 survey window).
- **★ QUEUED — guild LEAVE transition (the user-confirmed next guild target).**  PORT-DEBT(guild-leave-transition,
  NOT yet code-tagged): the proper iv1_16 bread cutscene = the flag==1 (post-purchase) Leave path = the c2c/c28
  transition → iv1_16 fade + world-map swap + the return-to-Recettear Tear cutscene (+ the buy-commit
  `save[0x2bc5d]=1`).  Other guild debts (untagged): Sell (mode 3), first-buy tutorial/limit gates, Talk
  submenu / Fusion (FUN_00493616) / Expansion flows, the FUN_004922c0 daily-event probe + group-6 cutscenes,
  the mid-transition bg path, the variant-1 (ichiba, dest 1) set.  Also queued: town scenes off the world map.
- **★ QUEUED — menu-boundary residuals (item-display arc's worst frame).**  Menu-OPEN slide-in ramp phase in
  `DAT_0734b98c` (label 125, gt8≈29k; ASYMMETRIC — pin by instrumenting the port counter vs the untraced
  retail counter) · rngcalls ±31 at the boundary · companion cx/cz/canim/cframe + pcnt micro-DRIFT · retail
  draws the hand-cursor snap 1f EARLIER at menu open (label 587) · menu-close camera pan-out whole-frame
  offset (label 441).  Menu polish: description-panel line layout (price / "Number possessed" X) · slide-in
  check · row flash.  Detail: `findings/shop-display-menu-RE.md`.
- **★ DEFERRED (polish pass, user-OK):**
  - **LOADING-SCREEN FIDELITY (user direction 2026-06-11):** replicate retail's load fades/screens, don't
    fast-load/suppress.  First instance (not yet RE'd): ESC-skipping the guild first-visit cutscene plays a
    brief fade-to-black in retail (lead: the stubbed skip-teardown FUN_00473c03 restore); + the retail-only
    screen-blackout layer (quirk §122); + PORT-DEBT(blackout-tut-dispatch) wiring for guild/tutorial
    cutscenes.  Keep in mind on ANY transition / dialogue-skip teardown / `{caprange}` load seam.
  - faint ambient particle dots (user ref-crops 2026-06-05) · next-line "book" arrow blink phase (draw from
    per-script-reset `rt->blink`, add to `{phasepin}`) · per-line pose precision ~2px (prompt/markup glyphs;
    if real, cross-ref the 0x467664 right-align scale) · price-trend tints FUN_004361b2 (several sites,
    registry-tracked) · extend the RETAIL 0x48670f hook with b598/b58c for full state-panel parity ·
    pause-xp-anim (XP animator, only matters mid-rank-up; NOT code-tagged) · title-picker-overwrite (code-4/6
    new-game overwrite-dim + per-slot avail; NOT code-tagged; needs a new-game-into-slot trace).
  - **Title NEW GAME (the "hardest, last" intro/prologue thread):** retail intro-video force-skip D4 + the
    prologue mid-load actor-spawn gap (`findings/conversation-pose-driver.md`) — the last title item.
  - TODO: run the pinned RETAIL census (Frida host) + census other scenes (`findings/phase-state-census.md`).
  - Tooling caveats (revisit only if bitten): `merge_anchor_seq` column ordering is best-effort;
    `orv3_view.build_view` (legacy PNG-bake) is not threaded — add the `join_anchor` pass-through if ever
    needed for cc08.
- **Phase:** frame-by-frame 1:1 parity sweep along the player path (title →
  prologue → HOUSE → shop loop → world map → dungeon). Strategy + tooling roadmap:
  **`audits/2026-06-09-methodology-audit.md`** (settled verdicts — behavioral-vs-
  byte-exact CLOSED, x87 invariant, T1–T12 tooling roadmap, milestone-ladder KPI).
  Read it before re-litigating strategy or building new parity tooling.
- **SETTLED VERDICTS (do NOT re-litigate):** the WALL-CLOCK pin is REFUTED — do not build it (RE §21.2 +
  the 2026-06-28 time-source sweep: QPC feeds only frame-pacing; loads are completion-based; phase consumers
  are frame-based — a clock pin fixes only the cosmetic FPS counter + audio fade).  `{gsimpin}` was removed
  (`9e1db6f`) — do NOT re-add (it forced gsim 1 behind).  The bilateral `{rngseed}` works as designed — no
  target-scoping/foundational pin needed.  The accepted cc08 render residuals (character +1f arrival-origin
  phase, ~2px per-glyph text precision, honest load-region join gaps) are NOT logic gaps.
- **Authoritative parity facts:** `findings/confirmed-parity-ledger.md`.  A tooling "divergence" on a
  human-confirmed-1:1 item is a lead to investigate, NOT an assumed regression.
