# OpenRecet — Progress Log

Reverse-chronological log of meaningful changes. Auto-generation TBD once
the test harness has coverage metrics worth reporting.

## 2026-05-19 — Project bootstrap

**What landed**
- Decisions (see [`PLAN.md`](PLAN.md) §3): C + mingw-w64 32-bit, DirectX
  direct, MIT, Win32-first drop-in.
- `flake.nix` with full RE toolchain (ghidra 12, radare2, rizin, cutter,
  retdec, imhex, wine staging, frida-tools, mingw32 i686 cross compiler,
  python env with construct/scikit-image/pillow/opencv, xvfb-run, scrot,
  ffmpeg, imagemagick, pandoc).
- Directory structure: `src/`, `tests/`, `tools/`, `docs/`, `vendor/` (gi),
  `ghidra/` (gi).
- Plan, README, MIT license, `.gitignore` that aggressively protects any
  derived game data, `.editorconfig`.

**What we know about the original**
- `recettear.exe`: 32-bit PE, **SteamStub-packed** (VLV signature @0x80),
  5.6 MB on disk.
- `custom.exe`: ~462 KB config tool reading `recet.ini`.
- Assets: `bin/data###.bin` (custom archives, format TBD), `xfile/*.x` and
  `xfile2/*.x` (DirectX retained-mode `.x` text models — open spec),
  `bgm/*.wav`, `ef/effect*.dat`, `bmpdata.bin`, `lnkdatas.bin`,
  `recet_op.wmv`.
- `recet.ini` exposes: `winmode`, `fps`, `dispfps`, `usefog`, `usemipmap`,
  `usetree`, `windowpos`, `uselighttex`, `nolight`, `easydisp`, `bgnodisp`,
  `texlevel`, `toorioff`, `s_easydisp`, `sfnouse`, `pfnouse`,
  `fontmode1`/`fontmode2`, `screen`, `texmode`, `mapmode`, `demomode`, plus
  `pad##` / `skill##` key bindings and `[config] se`/`mu` audio levels.
  These are the engine's main feature toggles — each one is a hint about
  a code path we'll meet.

**Note on wine vs WSLInterop** — WSL has `WSLInterop` registered as a
binfmt handler, so `.exe` invocations run natively on Windows by default.
We use that for Steamless and for casual play. The automated test harness
still uses wine + Xvfb so that (a) the runtime is pinnable via the flake
and (b) original-vs-ours diffs share the same backend and don't surface
wine-vs-Windows differences as phantom bugs. See `PLAN.md` §6 for details.

**Tooling landed**
- `tools/setup.sh` — symlinks game, runs Steamless via WSLInterop, prints sha256s.
- `tools/ghidra-headless.sh` + `tools/ghidra-scripts/ExportDecompiledC.py` —
  batch decompile every function to `docs/decompiled/` (gitignored).
- `tools/smoke-test.py` — Xvfb+wine runner with frame capture and SSIM diff
  against a golden run.
- `tools/contact-sheet.py` — single-set or side-by-side downscaled grids, with
  optional `--zoom` full-res crop strip.
- `tools/extract/xfile.py` — DirectX `.x` text-format summarizer + tree scanner.

**First extractor result (validates pipeline)** — running
`xfile.py xfile/city/dun_city00.x` on the user's Steam install reports:

| template               | count |
|------------------------|------:|
| Material               |    58 |
| TextureFilename        |    25 |
| Frame                  |    13 |
| FrameTransformMatrix   |    13 |
| Mesh                   |    12 |
| MeshMaterialList       |    12 |
| MeshNormals            |    12 |
| MeshTextureCoords      |    12 |
| MeshVertexColors       |     1 |

All **standard DirectX 9 retained-mode** templates. No custom extensions →
`xfile/` and `xfile2/` can be parsed with stock `D3DXLoadMeshFromX*` or any
open-spec parser. (Phase 2 will scan the full tree for a definitive answer.)

**Flake quirk** — `retdec` currently fails to build in nixpkgs (capstone
sub-build error). Disabled it. Ghidra + radare2/rizin cover decompilation
cross-checks. Re-enable if upstream fixes.

**Next** (Phase 1 entry)
- User runs `./tools/setup.sh` to unpack the exe.
- Then `./tools/ghidra-headless.sh` to produce `docs/decompiled/`.
- First subsystem to map: WinMain + main loop. Find `D3D*Create*` calls in
  the decompiled output → confirms DirectX version (likely 8 or 9).

---

## 2026-05-19 — Setup ran, first findings from unpacked binary

- ✅ `tools/setup.sh` ran successfully on the user's machine — Steamless via
  WSLInterop produced `vendor/unpacked/recettear.unpacked.exe` (5.0 MB,
  down from 5.6 MB packed; 7 PE sections → 6 sections; VLV signature gone).
- Fixed `tools/ghidra-headless.sh`: nixpkgs ghidra names its binaries
  `ghidra-<tool>` (e.g., `ghidra-analyzeHeadless`), not bare `analyzeHeadless`.

**New findings — recorded in [`findings/imports-and-layout.md`](findings/imports-and-layout.md):**

- **DirectX version is 8** (d3d8.dll / d3d8d.dll / D3DERR_*). Fixed-function
  pipeline only — no shaders, no HLSL compiler required.
- **DirectX is loaded dynamically** via `LoadLibraryA` + `GetProcAddress` —
  static imports are only `KERNEL32`, `USER32`, `SHELL32`, `WINMM`,
  `ole32`, `ADVAPI32`. Six DLLs total. Very tight.
- **`DirectXFileCreate` is used** for `.x` model parsing (open DX File API).
- **No `dsound.dll` / `dinput.dll` static imports.** Audio likely via
  `WINMM` (`mciSendString` / `waveOut*`) or dynamically-loaded DSOUND;
  input likely raw `USER32` `WM_KEYDOWN` / `GetKeyState`. To be confirmed.
- **Asset layout discovered from strings:** the binary references
  `bmp/item/item%02d.bmp`, `bmp/item_win.tga`, `data/item.txt`,
  `bin/se/.../*.bin`, etc. None of these paths exist on disk — confirming
  that `bin/data###.bin` archives contain the `bmp/` (TGA/BMP textures)
  and `data/` (plain text gameplay tables) trees. Cracking this format
  unlocks all 2D art and all gameplay data.
- **All UI/dialogue strings are inline in `.rdata`** — no string table,
  no `.po` files. i18n story is "rebuild the binary".

**Next**
- ~~Run `./tools/ghidra-headless.sh`~~ Done — 2620 functions decompiled.
- ~~Locate the function that opens `bin/data000.bin` → archive format~~
  Pre-empted: spec was already cracked by UnrealPowerz/recettear-repacker.
- Locate `WinMain` and the `LoadLibraryA("d3d8.dll")` site → document
  the window+device init sequence for the skeleton in phase 3.

## 2026-05-19 — Ghidra working, cross-references absorbed

**Ghidra:**
- Fixed the post-script: nixpkgs Ghidra 12 isn't built with PyGhidra, so
  `.py` scripts fail. Rewrote `ExportDecompiledC` in **Java** — works
  in plain headless mode without flags.
- Also fixed a latent bug: the script had `-deleteProject` set on the
  first import, which would have wiped analysis state. Removed.
- Result: **2620 functions** decompiled into `docs/decompiled/all.c`
  (6.3 MB), `by-address/*.c`, `by-name/*.c`, `functions.csv`.

**Cross-reference projects** (cloned to `/opt/src/`):
- **UnrealPowerz/recettear-repacker** — full spec for `bin/data*.bin`
  archives. Format: 10 MiB chunks of LZSS-compressed blobs indexed by
  big-endian `lnkdatas.bin`. Custom LZSS variant with 12-bit back-distance
  + MSB-first ctrl byte. `bmpdata.bin` is a separate LZW-compressed
  update overlay.
- **ribeena/RecettearXTools** — `.x` ↔ USD Blender 4.1 converter; useful
  for double-checking our `.x` parser.
- **just-harry/FancyScreenPatchForRecettear** — runtime widescreen
  patcher; useful as a map of engine offsets we'll want to understand.

**New format spec:** [`formats/data-bin.md`](formats/data-bin.md).

**Our own extractor:** `tools/extract/data-bin.py` — clean Python
reimplementation matching the spec. Validated against upstream:
**byte-identical** output on the current Steam build (1188 files extracted).
Run `./tools/extract/data-bin.py vendor/original --validate-against
/opt/src/recettear-repacker` to re-verify.

**Newly confirmed about the engine:**
- **DirectInput 8** (`dinput8.dll`) is also dynamically loaded — found
  `DirectInput8Create` symbol at `0x4a1cc0`.
- **C++ compiled with MSVC** — `vector_constructor_iterator` /
  `vector_deleting_destructor` indicate array new/delete scaffolding.
- **MFC is statically linked** — `RFX_Text_Bulk` (MFC ODBC field exchange)
  present. Probably leakage from `custom.exe` sharing libs; possibly
  engine uses some MFC for save serialization (TBD).
- PE entry is at `0x5046c7` — MSVC `__tmainCRTStartup`. `WinMain`
  symbolic name not yet auto-resolved.

**Next investigation targets**
1. Trace `__tmainCRTStartup` → `WinMain`. Rename in the Ghidra project.
2. From `WinMain`, find the `LoadLibraryA("d3d8.dll")` call → document the
   DX8 device-creation sequence. (Skeleton for phase 3.)
3. Read `recettear-repacker/crc.py` — the engine probably uses the same
   CRC as a path hash for `bmpdata.bin` lookups. Worth porting.
4. Optional: read `FancyScreenPatchForRecettear` patch sites to find
   resolution-clamping code (a likely candidate for an early test
   subsystem since the patches are small and well-isolated).

## 2026-05-19 — Engine bootstrap mapped end-to-end

Full writeup in [`findings/winmain-and-bootstrap.md`](findings/winmain-and-bootstrap.md).
Highlights:

- **WinMain at `0x47bfb3`**. Identified by the standard MSVC
  `__tmainCRTStartup(hInst=GetModuleHandleA(NULL), 0, lpCmdLine, nCmdShow)`
  call signature in the PE entry.
- **Engine internal name is "Azumanga"** — that's EGS's name for their
  custom engine (also powers Chantelise). Window class is literally
  `"Azumanga Main Window"`.
- **Window title is `"RECETTEAR Ver 1.108"`** — exact version string for
  drop-in compatibility.
- **Debug logger `FUN_0047aa31` is a 1-byte `return;` stub** — all
  logging compiled out in the release build. The `s_init_*` string
  constants remain in `.rdata` as breadcrumbs, which **gave us the full
  subsystem init order for free**:
  `start → strage → print → dinput → render → indexfile → fontsys →
  daoudio → fontsystem → systemtex → savefile → titletex → main loop`.
  (Note Japanese-English typos preserved: `strage`, `daoudio`.)
- **Main loop function: `FUN_0047be92`** — the game tick.
- **`Direct3DCreate8(0xDC)` at line 77975 of `all.c`** — `0xDC = 220 =
  D3D_SDK_VERSION`. Global `IDirect3D8 *` is `DAT_073dfcb8`.
- **DirectInput 8 init: `FUN_0047af52`** — keyboard + EnumDevices for
  joysticks, with axis range ±5000 and 100-unit deadzone.
- **Storage init: `FUN_004341fe`** — tries `lnkdata.bin` (JP name) first,
  falls back to `lnkdatas.bin` (EN name). Validates the index via
  `FUN_00474f14` which must return `-0x7456` (`0xFFFF8BAA`); this is the
  engine's integrity hash, almost certainly matches
  `recettear-repacker/crc.py`.
- **WndProc `FUN_0047b2e7`** handles `WM_CREATE`, `WM_DESTROY`,
  `WM_ACTIVATE` (pause + DI un/acquire), `WM_CLOSE` (confirm dialog in
  windowed), `WM_KEYDOWN` (ESC only — rest of input via DInput).

**Process docs added:** [`AGENT-WORKFLOW.md`](AGENT-WORKFLOW.md) — codifies
the Opus-orchestrator / Sonnet-subagent split + briefing template + stop
conditions. Read at the start of every new session.

**Stop point:** engine bootstrap is mapped. Logical next milestone:
either (a) write the phase-3 skeleton drop-in `src/main.c` matching the
init order, or (b) start translating the high-value individual functions
(`FUN_0047be92` game tick, `FUN_00474f14` integrity hash, the d3d8 wrapper
that calls `Direct3DCreate8`). User to choose.

---

## 2026-05-19 — Phase 3 skeleton drop-in runs

**`src/main.c` + `src/Makefile` written and building.** The skeleton
mirrors the bootstrap chain from
[`findings/winmain-and-bootstrap.md`](findings/winmain-and-bootstrap.md):
high-resolution timer setup → window class register (`"Azumanga Main
Window"`) → CreateWindowExA (`"RECETTEAR Ver 1.108"`) → LoadLibraryA
(`d3d8.dll` → `d3d8d.dll` fallback) → `Direct3DCreate8(D3D_SDK_VERSION)`
→ `IDirect3D8::CreateDevice` → message pump with `PeekMessage`/
`WaitMessage`/`tick_and_present`. Each subsystem in the original's init
order is a `TODO` comment naming the `FUN_XXX` we still need to
translate.

**Builds at 77 KB** via `i686-w64-mingw32-gcc` from inside `nix develop`.
Static libs: `-ld3d8 -ldinput8 -ldsound -lwinmm -lgdi32 -luser32
-lkernel32 -lole32 -ladvapi32 -lshell32`.

Tick path currently does `Clear → BeginScene → EndScene → Present` with
a distinctive **debug magenta** clear color (`160, 32, 96`) so a working
boot is visually obvious vs a black-screen failure.

**Test harness pivoted to WSLInterop** (see updated `PLAN.md` §6):

- Modern nixpkgs `wineWow64Packages.stagingFull` skips the 32-bit
  `syswow64/` layer → 32-bit binaries fail to load `kernel32.dll`.
- `wineWowPackages.stagingFull` (classic dual-arch) builds from source on
  every machine, slow.
- WSL2 + WSLInterop is rock solid and runs the exe natively on Windows.
  Trade-off: tests pop a window on the desktop. We'll work around this
  with self-emitting back-buffer captures inside the exe
  (`--capture-to <dir>`, not yet wired).
- Wine dropped from the flake entirely.

`tools/smoke-test.py` rewritten — no Xvfb, no wine, no scrot. Launches the
exe via WSLInterop, captures exit code + duration + stdout/stderr + sha256.
First run: `openrecet.exe` ran cleanly for 3 seconds, was killed by
timeout (exit code -15, SIGTERM), `taskkill /F /IM openrecet.exe` confirmed
clean shutdown.

**Next**
1. Wire `--capture-to <dir>` into `src/main.c` — save back-buffer as 32-bit
   BMP every N frames, into the harness's `runs/<scenario>/<id>/frames/`.
2. Translate `FUN_00474f14` (the lnkdatas integrity hash) to validate our
   `tools/extract/data-bin.py` matches the engine's expected sentinel.
3. Start filling in subsystem stubs — first target: `FUN_004341fe`
   (storage init / lnkdatas loader) so the skeleton actually opens the
   game's index file. Good Sonnet-subagent task.

---

## 2026-05-19 — All three subagent tasks landed; capture pipeline works end-to-end

**Subagent 2: CRC hash port** — `src/lnkdatas_hash.{c,h}` +
`tools/extract/lnkdatas_hash.py`. Algorithm identified as
**CRC-16/CCITT-FALSE** (poly `0x1021`, init `0xFFFF`, MSB-first, final
`~crc`). Validates byte-identical against `recettear-repacker/crc.py`;
on the real `lnkdatas.bin` (sha256 `6c5b93cf…`) returns `0x8BAA`
(= `-0x7456`, the engine's "valid" sentinel).

**Subagent 3: Storage init port** — `src/storage.{c,h}`. Caught a
critical detail the first writeup missed: **`FUN_004341fe` has two
distinct format paths**. The JP build's `lnkdata.bin` (singular) has a
5-byte header skipped + a `byte' = 0x01 - byte` payload transform +
sentinel `0xC5E1`. The EN build's `lnkdatas.bin` (plural) is raw +
sentinel `0x8BAA`. Both implemented. Findings doc
[`winmain-and-bootstrap.md` §"Storage init"](findings/winmain-and-bootstrap.md)
corrected.

**Subagent 1: Frame capture** — `src/main.c` gained `--capture-to <dir>`
+ `--capture-every N` CLI flags. Renders BMPs at intervals via
`GetBackBuffer → LockRect → fwrite`. Initially silent-failed; root cause
identified as needing `D3DPRESENTFLAG_LOCKABLE_BACKBUFFER` in the present
parameters AND capturing **before** `Present()` (we use
`D3DSWAPEFFECT_DISCARD` which makes post-Present back-buffer undefined).
Both fixed. Capture now runs at ~5000 FPS in the empty-tick state
(660 frames captured in 4 seconds of un-vsync'd rendering — capture
overhead is negligible).

**Subagent integration issues** worth noting for future use of the
AGENT-WORKFLOW pattern:
- The first attempt at subagent 1 (frame capture) failed because
  `isolation: worktree` requires an existing git commit — we have none
  yet. Re-ran without isolation; safe because the other two created only
  new files. **Action:** make an initial commit before relying on
  worktree isolation.
- Subagents 2 and 3 raced on the `lnkdatas_hash` signature: subagent 2
  used `(buf, size) → int16_t`, subagent 3 assumed `(size, buf) →
  uint16_t` and inlined a fallback impl in `storage.c`. Caused a
  duplicate-symbol link error. **Action:** when subagents share an
  interface, brief them with the exact signature, not "infer it".
- Subagent 3 caught the JP/EN dual-format detail in `FUN_004341fe` that
  the orchestrator (me, Opus) had missed in the initial writeup. Good
  outcome — second-pass careful reading by a fresh agent surfaced
  something a quick first read glossed over.

**End-to-end visual confirmation:**
- User reported seeing the debug-magenta window during a manual run.
- Captured BMP frame 60 center pixel = exactly `RGB(160, 32, 96)`.
- 4-tile contact sheet via `tools/contact-sheet.py` shows all magenta.
- Pipeline: mingw32 build → `openrecet.exe` (91 KB) → WSLInterop →
  Windows 32-bit process → `storage_init()` loads 1188 lnkdatas entries
  via the EN path → DX8 device with `LOCKABLE_BACKBUFFER` → tick loop
  → BMP captures → contact sheet → visual diff ready.

**Tooling fix:** `tools/contact-sheet.py` now sets
`ImageFile.LOAD_TRUNCATED_IMAGES = True` to bypass PIL's strictness on
32-bit BI_RGB BMPs with an X-padding byte. The BMPs are structurally
valid (file size, headers, pixel layout all correct — verified manually);
PIL treats the X byte as alpha and trips a bounds check. Not actually
truncated.

**Stop point.** Skeleton boots, has working frame capture, has real
lnkdatas integrity-validated load. Logical next milestones (pick one,
or parallelize via subagents per AGENT-WORKFLOW.md):

1. **Initial git commit** so future subagents can use `isolation: worktree`.
2. **Translate `FUN_004341d4`** — the file-size helper used by storage init
   (currently we reimplemented it inline; matching the original is cleaner).
3. **Translate `FUN_0047af52`** — the DirectInput8 init chain.
4. **Translate `FUN_00475270`** — the "init indexfile ok" subsystem, almost
   certainly the `bmpdata.bin` LZW loader (cross-reference with
   `/opt/src/recettear-repacker/bmp_unpack.py`).
5. **Translate `FUN_00454e69` + surroundings** — the D3D8 device creation
   site, so we can match the original's exact present parameters and
   render-state initial values (necessary for pixel-identical diffs once we
   have real rendering).
6. **First real rendering** — load a single TGA from the extracted assets
   and draw it via a screen-aligned quad. Confirms the texture pipeline
   before we tackle any of the engine's actual draw paths.
- Wire up `tools/ghidra-headless.sh` for batch decompilation.
- Confirm DirectX version from unpacked imports.
- First extractor: `xfile.py` (validate pipeline against known format).

---

## 2026-05-19 — First real rendering: TGA + screen-aligned quad

**What landed:** `src/tga.{c,h}` (uncompressed truecolor TGA Type 2, 24/32-bit,
bottom-up or top-down → BGRA), `src/sprite.{c,h}` (`IDirect3DTexture8` via
`CreateTexture(D3DPOOL_MANAGED) + LockRect + memcpy`, screen-aligned quad
via `D3DFVF_XYZRHW | DIFFUSE | TEX1` + `DrawPrimitiveUP`, with
`SRCALPHA/INVSRCALPHA` blending and the standard half-pixel offset).
Wired into `src/main.c` behind a `--show-tga <path>` CLI flag.

**Verification.** Ran `openrecet.exe --show-tga bmp/window.tga
--capture-to <dir> --capture-every-ms 500` for 4 seconds via WSLInterop;
captured 8 BMPs showing the 64×64 `window.tga` (a rounded UI button)
correctly alpha-blended over the debug-magenta clear. Math check on
frame 4: TGA pixel `(32,32) = (23,23,47, α=133)` blended over
`(160,32,96)` predicts `(88, 27, 70)`; captured pixel reads `(89, 27,
70)` — agrees to within rounding.

**Engine-accuracy gap recorded** in
[`findings/texture-loader.md`](findings/texture-loader.md). `FUN_0047193c`
(the original's loader) hands work to `D3DXCreateTextureFromFileInMemoryEx`
(identified by 15-arg call site + D3DXERR_INVALIDDATA error path). For
BMPs it applies the green color-key `0xFF00FF00`; TGAs use native alpha.
We deliberately bypass d3dx8 (not in nixpkgs, deprecated) and will grow
our own decoders to match the engine's output. Current `tga.c` handles
Type 2 only — BMP-with-color-key and RLE-TGA come next.

**Next milestones (unchanged from prior stop point except #6 done):**

1. Translate `FUN_004341d4` (file-size helper).
2. Translate `FUN_0047af52` (DInput8 init chain).
3. Translate `FUN_00475270` (`bmpdata.bin` LZW loader; cross-ref
   `recettear-repacker/bmp_unpack.py`).
4. Translate `FUN_00454e69` + neighbours (D3D8 device creation, for
   matching the original's present parameters and initial render states).
5. Port `FUN_0047193c` properly — read assets via `storage_*`, accept
   BMPs with the green color-key, add RLE-TGA. Replaces `--show-tga`'s
   direct-file path.
6. ~~First real rendering~~ — done (this entry).
